                Your task is to create the website for a blog post about the Erased Tapes Records music label.
                <br><br>
                You must implement the website according to the [written specification](#target-devices) and [wireframe
                mock-ups](wireframes) provided. For any details that have not been specified, you must make appropriate
                design decisions about how to implement that detail. All required changes to the design on different
                screen sizes are shown in the wireframes or are explained below. The images and placeholder text you
                will need are provided in the [`assets`](assets) folder.

                <br><br>
                You will work in a small group to develop a presentation on an Indie Game title. You will assign roles within your group, negotiating on who is best to cover each role. You should consider forming your team based on including classmates with varied interests within the context of game development. The group will analyze an existing indie game from the perspective of key industry roles - e.g. Game Developer (game structure, mechanics, logic), Level Designer, Game Writer, Concept Artist, Producer (production methods, schedules, marketing, Social Media campaigns, liaising with fans). 
                <br><br>
                You must define what you think the motivations and the goals of each person in these key industry roles were in creating the game.
